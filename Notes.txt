AVOID EVENT LISTENERS MEMORY LEAK:
    After each listener has done its job, remove its event handler from emitter
    emitter.removeListener({{EventName}}, eventHandlerFunction);

BUY ORDER:
{ OrderId: '583a3298-8cd7-41f9-a08c-a675b42d3917',
  MarketName: 'BTC-ETH',
  MarketCurrency: 'ETH',
  BuyOrSell: 'Buy',
  OrderType: 'LIMIT',
  Quantity: 0.03393666,
  Rate: 0.027986925 }

  TEST: Manage partial quantities over time (how to get filled amount from the already partial field order)

TODO: Manage outask when ask goes too low (compared to buy rate)
sometimes, another bot will outask drastically and the ask will become same as what I bidded
risks: waiting for ask to go back up ? => not seliing

TODO: Manage request timeouts for buy sell and cancel (Done but not sure if right strategy)

TODO: FIX: log below shows that order has been outasked,
           then already closed when trying to cancel it,
           then cancelled (???)
           then nothing ? no fill ?
      HINT: look at OutAskManager (just after cancel)
